Vi ser dem alle steder: Website adresser, der starter med "www". Det er næsten så
indgroet en del af os, at vi automatisker taster det, når vi skal besøge et
website.

It’s about time we kill the “www”. I don’t mean the World Wide Web, obviously, but the three letters that appear at the beginning of a plethora of website addresses.

Seen from a human perspective they serve very little purpose these days. Sure, many people believe they are required - and in some cases they are due to technical oversights - and will happily enter them in the address bar.

It could be argued that they make it easy to recognize a website address. I agree, everybody recognizes “www.example.com” as a website address. However, my guess is that people are just as likely to recognize “example.com”. The dot and the 2-4 letters following it are what makes a website address - both on a technical level, but also in peoples minds.

## Why it’s bad

The World Wide Web is the only thing I know of whose shortened form takes three times longer to say than what it’s short for.

Det gav fint mening i gamle dage.
